# Brackets_Extension_SASS_Autocompile
An Extension for the Code-Editor Brackets to autocompile SASS-Files while saving.
SASS-Compiler from: https://github.com/medialize/sass.js/

After installing the Extension, a new Menu called "Sass Compiler" should be in the top-Menubar. There are three options in this menu:
  - Select Source: Select the folder where all your .scss files are located. Make sure the main-scss-file, that one where all your        imports are coming together is called "main" or "Main"
  - Select Destination: Select the CSS file you want your scss-files to be compiled in.
  
After these steps you can enable the autocompile by clicking on "Activate Autocompile"

The compiler will be activated at every time you save your files or manually by pressing ALT+F.
